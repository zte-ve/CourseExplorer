# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### GFG PROJECT RELATED:
How this project, courseExplorer, respond to these key features

### A user friendly and respnsive ChatBot that will deal with user's queries regarding courses details, FAQs related to courese and their personal queries that are not covered in FAQs

### FAQ integration I am using a dataset of FAQs made from sothbey's institute data which covers most of the users questions

### NLP -> I was trying to use tensorflow.js BERT model to answer the queries of users related to given topics based on articles present about the topic on site and ask of user satisfaction and based on that add it to the queries setion permanently  (but unfortunately at last moments some error was occuring in my model and I was not able to do that part)

### fallback to doubt assistant not implemented

### user satisfaction not implemented
But I was planning on using a feedback form where user rate with stars to the chatbot's perf afyter ending the conservation

### data sharing and perf monitoring not implemented


## about projet
I have used react to create this project
react-chatbot-kit specifically to create this chatbot
and using tensorflow.js bert model for nlp(but that is not working yet)
my own logic to implement other things :)

About dataSet: the dataset I am using is quite rigged I have use GFG data for courses and sothbey's data for FAQs and queries after all this was learning project and not for deployment.

.menu is not implemented yet! sorry for that!
